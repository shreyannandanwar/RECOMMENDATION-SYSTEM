## **1. Project Overview**

This project aims to build a **sentiment analysis model** that classifies customer reviews as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. As a beginner in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), I utilized **TF-IDF vectorization** for text feature extraction and **Logistic Regression** for classification. The project provided hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

### **Key Objectives:**
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing raw text data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Converting text data into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.
- **Model Building**: Training a Logistic Regression model for classification.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using various metrics.

## **2. Tools, Platform, and Environment**

### **Development Setup:**
- **Editor**: [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - For interactive coding and visualization.
- **Platform**: [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) - For managing Python environments and dependencies.
- **Code Editor**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Used occasionally for cleaner interfaces and multi-file workflows.

### **Libraries Used:**
- [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/): For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): For TF-IDF vectorization, Logistic Regression, and model evaluation.
- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) and [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): For visualizing performance metrics like confusion matrices.

## **3. Dataset**

### **Source:**
- Downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

### **Description:**
- The dataset consists of **customer reviews** (text) and corresponding **sentiment labels** (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Inspiration**: Kaggle's community forums and notebooks provided valuable guidance during the project.

### **Dataset Structure:**
- **Columns**:
  - `review`: The text of the customer review.
  - `sentiment`: The sentiment label (positive, negative, neutral).

## **4. Project Workflow**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
Raw text data requires cleaning before it can be used for machine learning. The following steps were performed:
- **Lowercasing**: Converted text to lowercase for consistency.
- **Cleaning**: Removed punctuation, links, numbers, and stopwords to reduce noise.
- **Tokenization**: Split sentences into individual words.
- **Optional**: Explored stemming and lemmatization for further refinement.

### **2. Feature Extraction (TF-IDF Vectorization)**
- Used **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)** to convert cleaned text into numerical vectors.
- This step transformed textual data into a format that machine learning models could understand, capturing the "importance" of each word in the context of the entire dataset.

### **3. Model Building**
- **Data Splitting**: Split the dataset into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets.
- **Model Training**: Trained a **Logistic Regression** model using `scikit-learn`.
- **Model Choice**: Despite its simplicity, Logistic Regression proved effective for text classification when paired with TF-IDF features.

### **4. Model Evaluation**
Evaluated the model using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy Score**: Overall correctness of predictions.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualized true vs. predicted classifications using `seaborn` heatmaps.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: Provided deeper insights into model performance, especially for imbalanced datasets.

## **5. Outputs**

### **Confusion Matrix**
The confusion matrix provides a summary of prediction results, showing the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class.

### **Performance Metrics**
The performance metrics include:
- **Accuracy**: 85%
- **Precision**: 84%
- **Recall**: 86%
- **F1-Score**: 85%

## **6. Key Learnings**

1. **Data Cleaning is Critical**: Preprocessing raw text is just as important as building the model itself.
2. **TF-IDF is Powerful**: It’s an excellent starting point for feature extraction in NLP tasks.
3. **Logistic Regression Works Well**: Even simple models can perform effectively when paired with the right features.
4. **Beyond Accuracy**: Evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score provide a more nuanced understanding of model performance.

## **7. Future Scope and Improvements**

While this project was a great introduction to sentiment analysis, there’s plenty of room for growth:

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) to optimize the TF-IDF vectorizer and Logistic Regression settings.
2. **Multiclass Classification**: Extend the model to classify neutral and mixed sentiments.
3. **Advanced Models**: Experiment with **Naive Bayes**, **Random Forests**, or deep learning models like **LSTM** and **Transformers** for improved accuracy.
4. **Real-Time Sentiment Analysis**: Build a web app using **Flask** or **Streamlit** to predict sentiments on user input.
5. **Deployment**: Host the model on platforms like **Heroku** or **Render** for real-world use.
